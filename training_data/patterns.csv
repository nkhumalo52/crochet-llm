MOTIFS 
Notes for Red Heart Granny Square All in One yarn:
• Motifs begin with Color 1 (shortest color rep) from center of pull-skein, 
leaving a 4” [10 cm] tail to weave in.
• Each color aligns with 1 round (rnd) in the Motif with 5 colors in total. 
If too much color is left at end of rnd, pull back some stitches (sts) 
and slightly loosen gauge to re-work sts and finish at color change. If 
too little color is left, pull back some sts and slightly tighten gauge to 
re-work sts and finish at color change.
• When Motif is complete, cut yarn where Color 5 (longest color rep) 
ends, leaving a tail for weaving in. Begin next Motif with Color 1 and 
repeat 5 rnds for each Motif.
